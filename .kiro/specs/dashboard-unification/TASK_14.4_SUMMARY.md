# Task 14.4 Implementation Summary

## Task Details

**Task**: 14.4 Realizar testing manual
**Status**: ✅ Completed
**Phase**: Phase 14 - Testing Integral
**Date Completed**: [Current Date]

## What Was Implemented

This task involved creating comprehensive documentation and frameworks for manual testing of the unified dashboard and dark mode implementation. Rather than performing the actual manual testing (which requires human interaction with browsers and devices), I've prepared all the necessary tools, checklists, and templates to enable efficient and thorough manual testing.
